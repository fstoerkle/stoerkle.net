Nobody who ever gave his best regretted it.

With love and patience, nothing is impossible.

Hope is a risk that must be run.

It seems to be a law of nature, inflexible and inexorable, that those who will not risk cannot win.

Always aim at complete harmony of thought and word and deed. Always aim at purifying your thoughts and everything will be well.
    - Mahatma Gandhi

There's nothing like a dream to create the future.

Dreams come true if you survive the hard times.

In dreams and in love there are no impossibilities.

To accomplish great things, we must not only act, but also dream; not only plan, but also believe.

Wir sind Engel mit nur einem Flügel; um fliegen zu können, müssen wir uns umarmen.
